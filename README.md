# 🎁 GiftDrop

> **Friends secretly pool money for someone's gift — reveals automatically on the special day.**

GiftDrop is a decentralized group gifting platform built on Stellar, powered by Soroban smart contracts. Friends can silently contribute XLM toward a shared gift, with funds locked on-chain and automatically released to the recipient on the reveal date — or refunded to everyone if the target isn't met.

## 💡 Problem Statement

When a group of friends wants to pool money for a surprise gift, someone always has to be trusted with the funds — manually chasing people, collecting cash, and managing the entire process. This creates friction, trust issues, and often ruins the surprise.

**GiftDrop eliminates this entirely.** No coordinator needed. No trust required. The smart contract handles everything.

---

## 🎁 What is GiftDrop?

GiftDrop is a Web3 group gifting app on Stellar Testnet where:

- An **organizer** creates a Gift Drop with a target amount, recipient wallet, deadline, and reveal date
- **Friends** silently contribute XLM — all locked on-chain, invisible to the recipient
- On the **reveal date**, the full amount automatically releases to the recipient
- If the **target isn't met** by the deadline, everyone gets a full refund automatically

No middleman. No trust. Just code.

---

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

- 🎂 Birthday surprise gifts
- 👋 Farewell gifts for colleagues
- 🎉 Festival group gifting
- 🏢 Office celebration pools

## 📋 Smart Contract Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `create_gift` | Creates a new gift drop on-chain |
| `contribute` | Locks XLM contribution on-chain (subject to per-user contribution limit) |
| `get_gift` | Fetches gift drop details |
| `get_contributors` | Returns all contributors for a drop |
| `get_organizer_gifts` | Returns all drops created by organizer |
| `get_contributor_gifts` | Returns all drops contributed to |
| `reveal` | Releases funds to recipient on reveal date |
| `refund` | Refunds contributors if target not met |

---

## ⚡ Advanced Feature — Fee Sponsorship

GiftDrop implements **gasless transactions** using Stellar fee bump transactions. Contributors do not need XLM for gas fees — a sponsor account covers fees on their behalf.

**Implementation file:** `frontend/lib/contract.ts` → `contributeWithFeeSponsor()`

**How it works:**

1. Sponsor account wraps the contributor's inner transaction
2. Fee bump transaction covers all gas fees
3. Contributor signs and submits without needing XLM for fees

This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for new users — they only need XLM for their actual contribution, not for network fees.

---

## 📊 Metrics Dashboard

**Live URL:** https://giftdrop-five.vercel.app/metrics

The Metrics page is accessible directly from the **navigation bar** (added as part of recent improvements). It displays real-time on-chain data pulled from Stellar Testnet:

- Total transactions on the contract
- Network (Stellar Testnet)
- Smart contract address with direct Explorer link
- Full on-chain transaction history with hashes, types, dates, and individual Explorer links

**Screenshot:**

> *19 on-chain transactions as of March 30, 2026 — all verifiable on Stellar Expert.*

---

## 📡 Monitoring

GiftDrop uses a **custom logger** (`frontend/lib/logger.ts`) that logs all key application events with structured `[GiftDrop INFO]` prefixed messages. These are visible in the browser console and captured in Vercel deployment logs.

**Screenshot:**

![GiftDrop Monitoring — Console Logger](<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-28 201948" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f008025-d477-4669-8be8-18ab3b86d8ab" />

)

> *Console showing `[GiftDrop INFO] GiftDrop app loaded` — custom logger fires on every app load, confirming monitoring is active.*

**Monitoring stack:**
- Custom logger: `frontend/lib/logger.ts`
- Vercel deployment logs: Available in Vercel dashboard under the GiftDrop project
- On-chain transaction explorer: [Stellar Expert — Contract Transactions](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCKWQPTEXUAV7RK3WKD2T6YS4CLC4QE2KWI2MO4NHVAN4ABFJHA3YGVJ)

---

## 📈 Data Indexing

GiftDrop uses the **Stellar Horizon API** to index and display all on-chain transactions in the Metrics Dashboard.

**Indexing Endpoint:**
```
https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/CCKWQPTEXUAV7RK3WKD2T6YS4CLC4QE2KWI2MO4NHVAN4ABFJHA3YGVJ/transactions
```

**What is indexed:**
- All contract call transactions
- Transaction hashes and timestamps
- Contributor and organizer activity
- Live metrics: total transactions, total XLM contributed, active users
